# Neo4-js

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JanPeter/neo4js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JanPeter/neo4js)

Neo4-js is a object-graph mapper for JavaScript and neo4j with full flow-type support. Neo4-js hides repetitive queries such as the basic CRUD operations to the developer. For best development experience use flow-type from Facebook to obtain good autocomplete results.

In this document you'll find the basic usage of the library.

The documentation is currently not done...So please just have a look at the `__tests__` in the `src` directory.

For a basic usage example you can have a look at [neo4js-todo minimal](https://github.com/JanPeter/neo4js-todo/tree/minimal) and [neo4js-todo basic](https://github.com/JanPeter/neo4js-todo/tree/autocomplete).
